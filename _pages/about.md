I am currently a Software engineer at Google. I am working on defending gmail users using machine learning. It is pretty cool!

In the past, I have: 

- interned at CERN studying longitudinal beam dynamics

- carried out my master degree thesis at Volvo cars, working on novel object detection architectures

- collaborated with the Alan turing institute on a wide range of ML topics

- developed the open source library "Surrogates.jl" under the "Google summer of code framework"
